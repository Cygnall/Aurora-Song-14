# Markings are inheriting. That means they can have parents now. Yay!
# This file is mostly for species restriction lists.
# Keep in mind that there is no partial inheritance of species restrictions, so you have to redeclare the entire
# species restriction list in its entirety for each speciesRestriction property.

# Species for reference, excluding non-roundstart:
# Arachnid
# Diona
# Dwarf
# Felinid
# Feroxi
# Goblin
# Harpy
# Human
# IPC
# Moth
# Oni
# Reptilian
# Rodentia
# Sheleg
# SlimePerson
# Tajaran
# Vox
# Vulpkanin

# "Standard [Body Part]" - Species' whose base body sprites have the same silhouettes / position as humans.
# Not included are anything where that body part has a different silhouette. If the species has a
# displacement map that completely changes the way clothes look, like Vox, it probably shoudld be excluded.

  # Technically Tajaran are missing one pixel off the heel (like, very subtle digitigrade)
  # but I'm not removing them from the legs tattoo list just because of that.

# Non-standard species restrictions.
# Why single-species restrictions, you ask? I would like to minimize the amount of `speciesRestriction` redeclaration
# in general. Always easier to edit one prototype than it is to edit potentially dozens. Maybe you add a species that
# has an identical body but does something different - not that I recommend this.
